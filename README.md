# A Real-time Classroom Attendance System Utilizing Viola–Jones for Face Detection and LBPH for Face Recognition

## Abstract
The face of a human is crucial for conveying identity. Computer scientists, Neuro scientists, and psychologists, all exploits this human feature using image processing
techniques for commercial, and law enforcement applications. Likewise, this feature can be invited into classrooms to maintain records of students’ attendance. Con-
temporary traditional way of recording attendance involves human intervention and requires cooperation of the students which is hectic and contribute towards waste of
class time. An automated real-time classroom attendance system detects students from still image or video frame coming from a digital camera, and marks his/her
attendance by recognizing them. The system utilizes Viola–Jones object detection framework which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly with high detec-
tion rates. In the next stage, the detected face in the image is recognized using Local Binary Patterns Histogram.
